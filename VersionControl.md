# Version Control
This file will explore and explain the version control system that should be used for the project.
This will inclue what branches will be required, what time they need to be created, and what time they need to be merged into the master branch.
These times will be explained based on the assumption that the project goes smoothly, and according to plan.

## Branches Required
For each include the name of the branch, the branches purpose, the time it should be created, when it should be merged, and what functionality it should have when it is finished development (summary of the branches purpose again, but some application).
