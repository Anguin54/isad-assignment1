# Requirements and Planning
This file contains all the components for section 1.1 of the task - Requirements and Planning \
As directed by the headings, this file will contain sections 'User Stories', 'Use Cases' and 'Requirements', in that order. \

## User Stories
This section will contain all 10 of the user stories for the assignment. \
The main actors referred to will be the scientists, engineers and various service workers. \
The secondary actors referred to will generally be the database, sensors, actuators, \

### General Functional Requirements
1. 'Parking' the wind turbine in the event of a blizzard. \
2. Keeping track of where all the vehicles are - tracking software - in case a rescue is needed. \
3. Monitor the status of data collection systems (need for maintenance, have a regular test encoded, to run regularly, as scheduled tests). \
4. Monitor the status of the living quarters - suitable living conditions (temperature, air quality, etc.). \
5. Communicating with the outside world, in the case of emergencies. \
6. Keep track of weather cycles and to forewarn the inhabitants to any incoming weather disasters. \
7. Software to keep track of current food supplies and future incoming food supply (i.e. food status). \
8. Software to automatically, or manually, map the environment outside, and detect any major changes to the landscape. \
9. Monitor the electrical requirements and production of the entire base. This would include monitoring the fuel available for the generator, \
and alerting when a need arises, and the state of the battery, automatically performing regular tests. \
10. Know what season/time of year it currently is, to be able to make use of the solar panels when possible. \


### User Story 1 - Turbine Parking
As a service worker, I want to be able to 'park' (shut down operations and (somewhat) pack up) the wind turbine in the event of a blizzard, to avoid damage to the turbine. \

### User Story 2 - Vehicle Tracking
As staff on the base, I want to be able to track where all the vehicles for the base currently are, so that I can easily locate them to use in the event of an emergency. \

### User Stories 3.1 & 3.2 - Data Collection System Monitoring
As a service worker, I want to be able to monitor the current status of the data collection systems, to either know when scheduled maintenance is required, or be alerted if extra maintenance is required. \
As a scientist, I want to be alerted when/if a data collection systsem isn't working, to know to disregard data collected during a potentially faulty period.\

### User Story 4 - Living Quarters Monitoring
As a scientist, I want to be able to monitor the livability conditions of the living quarters, so that I can ensure a safe living standard. \

### User Story 5 - Outside World Communication
As staff on the base, I want to be able to communicate with the outside world, so that I can contact people in the case of an emergency. \

### User Story 6 - Weather Tracking
As a scientist, I want to be able to view the upcoming weather patterns to be able to prepare the base for any incoming weather disasters. \

### User Story 7 - Monitoring Food Supplies
As staff on the base, I want to be able to see the current status for the available food on the base, as well as be alerted of any unforseen circumstances, to be able to develop a ration plan, and a plan to deal with the situation going forth as soon as possible. \

### User Stories 8.1 & 8.2 - Environment Mapping
As staff on base, I want to be alterted to any drastic changes to the external landscape outside, to be able to develop a plan to deal with any changes. \
As a service worker, I want to be able to manually map the external landscape to be able to verify any major and impactful environment changes. \

### User Stories 9.1 & 9.2 - Monitor Electrical Requirements and State
As an engineer, I want to be able to view the electricity requirement and production to be able to ensure stable supply and demand of electricity. \
As a service worker, I want to be able to be alerted when the battery needs maintenance/is non-functional, so that I can perform the maintenance or sort out a new battery.\

### User Stories 10.1 & 10.2 - Solar Panel Use
As an engineer, I want to be alerted when the solar panels are available to be effectively used, so that I can increase the electrical production for the base. \
As a service worker, I want to be alterted when the solar panels are available to be effectively used, so that I can run diagnostics on the power system, and get it ready for use. \

## Requirements
### Usability Requirements
Usability requirements are requirements that directly relate to how useable the software is, and showcase how the software increases efficiency. \
For example the easy location and use of the software features. \
#### Usability Requirement 1


#### Usability Requirement 2


#### Usability Requirement 3


### Performance Requirements
Performance requirements are, logically, the requirements that relate to the softwares performance. \
This performance is commonly things like how efficiently the resources are used, how quickly it responds to an event and its' data processing speed. \
#### Performance Requirement 1


#### Performance Requirement 2


#### Performance Requirement 3


### Reliability Requirements 
Reliability requirements are requirements of the systems reliability. \
These requirements acknowledge an imperfect world, but set some standards of what the software **must** be able to do. \
#### Reliability Requirement 1


#### Reliability Requirement 2


#### Reliability Requrement 3
